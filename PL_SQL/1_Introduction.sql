=========================================
Section 1: Definition and Core Concepts of PL/SQL
=========================================
*/
-- PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL) is Oracle's procedural extension to SQL.
-- It combines SQL with procedural features like loops, conditions, and exceptions.
-- Core concepts include procedural programming, exception handling, and modularity.

/*
=========================================
Section 2: Historical Development of PL/SQL
=========================================
*/
-- PL/SQL was introduced by Oracle in 1991 with Oracle Database version 6.
-- Since then, it has evolved to support advanced features like object-oriented programming and integration with Oracle's advanced technologies.

/*

Section 3: Key Features and Advantages of PL/SQL
=========================================
*/
-- 1. Procedural Constructs: Loops, Conditions, and Variables.
-- 2. Modular Programming: Use of Functions, Procedures, and Packages.
-- 3. Error Handling: Built-in exception handling.
-- 4. Performance: Reduces the need for multiple round trips between application and database.
-- 5. Integration: Seamless interaction with SQL and Oracle Database.

/*
=========================================
Section 4: Differences Between SQL and PL/SQL
=========================================
*/
-- SQL:
--   - Declarative language used for querying and manipulating data.
--   - Executes one statement at a time.
--   - Focused on data operations.

-- PL/SQL:
--   - Procedural language that adds logic and control flow to SQL.
--   - Supports loops, conditions, and modular programming.
--   - Focused on building complex business logic within the database.

/*
=========================================
Section 5: Basic Syntax Structure and Components
=========================================
*/
-- PL/SQL Block Structure:
-- 1. Anonymous Block (Basic Syntax):
DECLARE
    variable_name datatype;
BEGIN
    -- Executable statements
EXCEPTION
    -- Exception handling
END;
/

-- Example:
DECLARE
    v_name VARCHAR2(50) := 'Oracle';
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Welcome to ' || v_name || '!');
END;
/

/*
=========================================
Section 6: Common Use Cases and Applications
=========================================
*/
-- 1. Stored Procedures and Functions: Encapsulate reusable logic.
-- 2. Triggers: Automate actions based on database events.
-- 3. Exception Handling: Manage errors gracefully.
-- 4. Bulk Processing: Handle large data operations efficiently.

-- Example: Creating a Stored Procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE greet_user(p_name IN VARCHAR2) IS
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello, ' || p_name || '!');
END;
/

-- Example: Trigger
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_before_insert
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    :NEW.created_at := SYSDATE;
END;
/

/*
=========================================
Section 7: Best Practices and Coding Standards
=========================================
*/
-- 1. Use meaningful variable and procedure names.
-- 2. Modularize code with procedures and functions.
-- 3. Include error handling in all PL/SQL blocks.
-- 4. Optimize SQL statements within PL/SQL.
-- 5. Use comments for code clarity.

/*
=========================================
Section 8: Integration with Oracle Database
=========================================
*/
-- PL/SQL seamlessly integrates with Oracle features like:
-- 1. SQL Queries: Embedded within PL/SQL blocks.
-- 2. Dynamic SQL: Execute SQL statements dynamically using EXECUTE IMMEDIATE.
-- 3. Packages: Group related procedures, functions, and variables.

-- Example: Dynamic SQL
DECLARE
    v_sql VARCHAR2(100) := 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees';
    v_count NUMBER;
BEGIN
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql INTO v_count;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Total Employees: ' || v_count);
END;
/

/*
=========================================
Conclusion
=========================================
*/
-- PL/SQL is a powerful tool for implementing procedural logic in Oracle databases.
-- It enhances SQL by providing constructs for flow control, error handling, and modular programming.
-- Following best practices and understanding its integration capabilities can significantly improve database application performance and maintainability.
