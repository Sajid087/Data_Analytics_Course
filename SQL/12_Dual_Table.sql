/*
============================================
1. What is the DUAL Table?
============================================
- The DUAL table is a special one-row, one-column table provided by Oracle.
- It is used to select a pseudo result set when no actual table is needed.
- The table has a single VARCHAR2 column named "DUMMY" with a single row containing the value 'X'.
- Commonly used for testing expressions, calling functions, and performing calculations without requiring actual data.
*/

-- Example: Basic Usage of DUAL Table
SELECT 'Hello, World!' AS message
FROM DUAL;

/*
============================================
2. Historical Background
============================================
- Originated in Oracle to provide a means to return a result set without requiring a real table.
- Initially designed for internal use but became widely adopted by developers.
- Exists in Oracle databases but has counterparts or alternatives in other database systems.
*/

-- Example: Arithmetic Operation
SELECT 2 + 3 AS sum_result
FROM DUAL;

/*
============================================
3. Internal Structure of the DUAL Table
============================================
- The DUAL table contains one row and one column.
- It is part of the SYS schema but accessible to all users.
- The single row ensures predictable results when performing calculations or running expressions.
*/

-- Example: Viewing the Structure of DUAL Table
DESC DUAL;

-- Example: Verifying the Single Row in DUAL Table
SELECT *
FROM DUAL;

/*
============================================
4. Common Use Cases
============================================
- Performing arithmetic operations.
- Using date and time functions.
- Executing string manipulations.
- Calling system functions or constants.
- Generating dummy data for testing.
*/

-- Example: Using Date Functions
SELECT SYSDATE AS current_date
FROM DUAL;

-- Example: String Manipulation
SELECT UPPER('oracle sql') AS upper_case_string
FROM DUAL;

-- Example: Generating Sequence Numbers
SELECT ROWNUM AS sequence_number
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 5;

/*
============================================
5. Performance Implications
============================================
- DUAL table queries are highly optimized in Oracle.
- Oracle ensures minimal overhead when accessing the DUAL table.
- Avoid unnecessary queries to DUAL in performance-critical applications.
*/

-- Example: Calculating PI Value
SELECT ROUND(22/7, 2) AS pi_value
FROM DUAL;

/*
============================================
6. Differences Across Database Systems
============================================
- Oracle: Provides DUAL as a dedicated table with optimized performance.
- MySQL: Does not require DUAL for expressions; SELECT 1 works directly.
- PostgreSQL: Allows expressions without requiring a DUAL equivalent.
- SQL Server: Uses SELECT without a FROM clause for similar functionality.
*/

-- Example: MySQL Query Without DUAL
-- SELECT 'Hello, MySQL!' AS message;

-- Example: PostgreSQL Query Without DUAL
-- SELECT CURRENT_DATE;

/*
============================================
7. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
============================================
- Best Practices:
  - Use DUAL only when necessary (e.g., testing expressions, system calls).
  - Keep expressions simple and optimized.
- Common Pitfalls:
  - Overusing DUAL for tasks better suited to application logic.
  - Assuming DUAL exists in all database systems.
*/

-- Example: System Function Query
SELECT USER AS current_user
FROM DUAL;

/*
============================================
8. Practical Examples of DUAL Table Usage
============================================
*/

-- Example: Using DUAL for System Information
SELECT DBTIMEZONE AS database_timezone
FROM DUAL;

-- Example: Calculating a Future Date
SELECT SYSDATE + 30 AS future_date
FROM DUAL;

-- Example: Conditional Logic Using CASE
SELECT CASE
         WHEN SYSDATE > TO_DATE('2025-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') THEN 'Future'
         ELSE 'Present or Past'
       END AS date_status
FROM DUAL;

/*
============================================
9. Summary and Recommendations
============================================
- The DUAL table is a versatile and efficient feature in Oracle SQL for executing expressions, calculations, and system queries.
- Use it judiciously for tasks requiring no actual table data.
- Be aware of database-specific differences when working with DUAL-like functionality in other systems.
