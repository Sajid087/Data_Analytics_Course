1. Definition and Purpose of Natural Join
------------------------------------------
A Natural Join is a type of SQL join that automatically matches and combines columns from two tables based on columns with the same name and compatible data types.
It simplifies queries by eliminating the need to explicitly specify the join condition.

Purpose:
- To simplify queries when columns with the same name and meaning exist in multiple tables.
- To perform equijoins without writing detailed ON or USING clauses.
*/

/*
=============================================
2. Syntax and Basic Structure of Natural Join
---------------------------------------------
Syntax:
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
NATURAL JOIN table2;

Key Points:
- The Natural Join compares columns with the same name and combines matching rows.
- Only columns that appear in both tables are compared.
*/

-- Example: Basic Natural Join Syntax
SELECT *
FROM Employees
NATURAL JOIN Departments;

3. How Natural Join Automatically Matches Columns
---------------------------------------------
Natural Join automatically identifies columns with the same name and matches rows based on their values.
*/

-- Example: Matching Columns Automatically
-- Assume we have the following tables:
-- Employees Table:
-- | EmployeeID | Name       | DepartmentID |
-- |------------|------------|--------------|
-- | 1          | Alice      | 10           |
-- | 2          | Bob        | 20           |
-- | 3          | Charlie    | 10           |

-- Departments Table:
-- | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
-- |--------------|----------------|
-- | 10           | HR             |
-- | 20           | IT             |

-- Query:
SELECT *
FROM Employees
NATURAL JOIN Departments;

-- Expected Output:
-- | EmployeeID | Name       | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
-- |------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
-- | 1          | Alice      | 10           | HR             |
-- | 3          | Charlie    | 10           | HR             |
-- | 2          | Bob        | 20           | IT             |

=============================================
4. Difference Between Natural Join and Other Join Types
---------------------------------------------
- Natural Join automatically determines the join condition by matching columns with the same name.
- INNER JOIN requires an explicit ON or USING clause to specify the join condition.
- OUTER JOIN (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) includes unmatched rows, while Natural Join only includes matched rows.
*/

-- Example: Difference Between INNER JOIN and NATURAL JOIN
-- Using INNER JOIN:
SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments
ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;

-- Equivalent Natural Join:
SELECT *
FROM Employees
NATURAL JOIN Departments;

/*
=============================================
5. Common Use Cases and Scenarios for Natural Join
---------------------------------------------
- When working with normalized databases where column names are standardized.
- Quick and simple joins for reporting or data analysis tasks.
*/

/*
=============================================
6. Best Practices and Potential Pitfalls
---------------------------------------------
Best Practices:
- Ensure column names and data types are consistent across tables to avoid unexpected results.
- Use Natural Join when you are confident about column naming conventions.

Pitfalls:
- Ambiguity in column names can lead to errors or unintended behavior.
- It might be less flexible compared to explicitly specifying join conditions with INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN.
*/

-- Example: Best Practice with Natural Join
-- Ensure consistent naming conventions across tables.
SELECT Name, DepartmentName
FROM Employees
NATURAL JOIN Departments;

/*

7. Step-by-Step Examples Showing Natural Join in Action
---------------------------------------------
*/

-- Example 1: Natural Join with All Columns
SELECT *
FROM Employees
NATURAL JOIN Departments;

-- Example 2: Natural Join with Selected Columns
SELECT Name, DepartmentName
FROM Employees
NATURAL JOIN Departments;

-- Example 3: Natural Join with Additional Filtering
SELECT Name, DepartmentName
FROM Employees
NATURAL JOIN Departments
WHERE DepartmentName = 'HR';

8. Summary
---------------------------------------------
- Natural Join simplifies queries by matching columns with the same name and data type.
- It is best used in standardized databases with consistent naming conventions.
